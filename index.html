  <p class = "graph1" >When NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was asked about some of his proudest moments
as a commissioner, he responded by saying: “one of the areas that I’m increasingly proud of is
how global this league is.”</p>

<p class = "graph1" >The NBA today has more international players than ever before, and as a result, the league has been changing in multiple ways. But where exactly did this change begin, and why? What are the lasting impacts of these players, and what have these players done to widen the global scope of the NBA? This study details, analyzes and visualizes this journey beginning decades ago, answering these exact questions as to why and how international countries are making a name for themselves in the league.
</p>

  <p class = "graph2">To fully grasp the scope of how big of an increase there has been with NBA players the past few years, we must look at percentages of the years before the surge. Business Insider speaks on this: “During the 1980-81 season, only 1.7% of NBA players were born outside the United States. Over the next 17 seasons, the percentage of foreign-born players grew steadily to 7.6% in the 1997-98 season.” As of the 21st century, about 20 percent of the entire league is born outside of the United States. Obviously, the NBA is still majority North American. However, just because there's not as many foreign players doesn't mean they're not making their mark. For the past five seasons, the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) was a foreign player.</p> 

<p class = "graph2">Sports analyst Eduard Bueno echoes this: "This surge in international presence not only speaks to the league's global appeal but also underscores the growing talent pool and the increasing competitiveness on a global scale."</p>

</script>

    <p class = "graph3">Although there have always been foreign-born players since the near birth of the sport, it was never even close to the magnitude it's at today. A large surge of foreign-players can be pinpointed to the 1992 Olympics, when NBA players were granted to compete. 

    <p class = "graph3">After the wildly dominant performance of North America's players, nicknamed the "Dream Team", the NBA was clearly the place to be for all basketball players. From that point foward players from Europe, Africa, and Asia all began joining the NBA at a rapid pace.</p>

    <p class = "graph3">A plethora of players joined the league, but similar to any competitive sport, a handful of superstars rose and made a name for themselves. Notable international players such as Yao Ming, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Nikola Jokic are both results of the NBA expanding its global reach, and reasons for its continued expansion. These players are not just special because they're not born in the United States; they are some of the greatest players the sport has ever seen, which in turn gives foreign players a big name and market. The huge impact of these players is shown by the wild increase in international viewership as well. NBA Communications reported “ the 2023-24 regular season delivered record-breaking engagement in Europe and the Middle East” Reportedly, viewership of NBA on Youtube in Europe has increased by over 200 percent year-over-year, and is on the continued rise.

    <p class = "graph4">It's not just good looks and more fans these international players are getting either. The NBA has in turn been instituting global programs and development camps all around the world as a result of the international surge.</p>

    <p class = "graph4">The NBA Stuffer quotes: "the Basketball Without Borders (BWB) program, a global basketball development program run by the NBA and FIBA, has helped identify and develop some of the top international prospects who have gone on to have successful NBA careers." </p>


    <p class = "graph4">Along with the creation of multiple Global NBA Academies, the sport is continuously widening its lens. Individual foreign-born superstars have also made their own foundations and taken global networking positions, such as Yao Ming partnering with the NBA to make the first NBA School in Beijing, or Giannis starting his own academy, the Antetokounmpo Academy. Ultimately, the new modern league of international players has not only come off of their previous international predecessors to become the identity they are today, but has also paved a way for new and upcoming foreign players to continue their legacy. it is clear to see that the NBA has come a long way from what it started as.

    <img src = "pie chart.png">

    <p class = "graph5">The sport of basketball has heavily evolved from just the game. With the recent boom of international players, the league has seen a positive change in diversity, talent, and uniqueness. Beginning in the 90s, this boom has continuously proven to be what the league needed, echoed by the continuously-growing global fanbase, foundation camps, and recognition. With this continued trend, the NBA is on the pathway to continue this diversified development, creating even more opportunities to include prospects from all parts of the Earth to play and consume the ever-expanding sport of basketball.
